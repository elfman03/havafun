<html>
<h1>Hava Fun</h1>
Purpose:  Tell a hava streaming device to change channels or press buttons or send a high quality video stream.
<p>
For testing purposes, this package includes several tools and scripts.
<ul>
<li> <b>Linux</b>
<ul>
<li> hava_info -- Diagnogstic tool to print out some info hava reports
<li> hava_channel -- Change channels or press key buttons (e.g., power)
<li> hava_record -- Capture the high quality mpeg stream from hava
<li> example_live.sh -- Linux example that views mpeg stream
<li> example_record.sh -- Linux example that records, indexs, transcodes
<li> example_combined.sh -- Linux example that changes channels then views
</ul>
<li> <b>Windows</b>
<ul>
<li> hava_info.exe -- Diagnogstic tool to print out some info hava reports
<li> hava_channel.exe -- Change channels or press key buttons (e.g., power)
<li> hava_channel_nowin.exe -- Same as hava_channel.exe but without a console
<li> example_live.cmd -- BROKEN!!!  Windows example that TRIES to view mpeg stream 
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Prerequisites:</h2>
<ul>
<li> Hava with recent firmware (we will know more later)
<ul>
<li> Make sure you can play and change channels in the official Hava windows tool.  Hava Fun does not perform configuration of the Hava; it just pokes at it a bit.
</ul>
<li> For recording/viewing:
<a href="http://mplayerhq.hu">MPlayer/Mencoder</a> installed.
<ul>
<li> NOTE: Windows recording/viewing will not work...  Out of order packets require making a reorder buffer to resolve.  Linux is working much better without a reorder buffer.
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Hava Info Tool</h2>
<xmp>
Usage: hava_info
</xmp>
This dumps the periodic broadcast packet from your hava and the response to the initialize request that we send to hava.  If you have issues, please post the result of running this.

<h2>Hava Channel Tool</h2>
<xmp>
Usage: hava_channel <hava_dotform_ipaddr> <target_channel_number>
       hava_channel <hava_dotform_ipaddr> {POW,POWON,POWOFF,SEL}

NOTE: If you use '-' for the ipaddr, it will try to autodetect
      This mode is not recommended but can be useful for testing.  It will crash if you are using the hava player at the same time.
</xmp>
The first one lets you choose a channel.  Unless you are playing a video stream at the same time that you invoke hava_channel, you should get back an ack=1.  If you are playing a video stream at the same time, we cannot check for acknowledgements..
<h2>Hava Record Tool</h2>
<xmp>
Usage: hava_record <hava_dotform_ipaddr> <duration_sec> <tgt_mpeg>

NOTE: If you use '-' for the <tgt_mpg>, it will send the output to stdout
      This is recommended for piping into mplayer/mencoder

NOTE: If you use '-' for the ipaddr, it will try to autodetect
      This is not recommended but can be useful for testing
</xmp>
The first one lets you record to a file.  This file will not be indexed and will start in the middle of a frame (it will play back with mplayer but little else.  Mencoder can reindex it so that it can play in more places...
<p>
The second one does the same thing but sends the output to stdout for piping into mplayer or mencoder.  See the example scripts.

<h1>Long term goals: </h1>

The end target use is to use the hava_util.h interface to extend a video streaming program like MythTV to support Hava (I use it today in MythTV for channel changing and hope to start using it for video capture).  
To use, you need to have a hava device on your local network and determine its
IP address.  Then use one of the following forms to tell the hava what to do.

<h1>Release Details</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Release alpha2 -- 8/30/2009</h2>
First version with record capability.  Added some sample play scripts and a hava_info tool for diagnostics.  Corresponds to checkin svn revision 13.
<p><b>Fixed:</b>
<ul>
<li> Windows channel changing without a console window popup (sagetv)
<li> Modularization to faciliate creating a "clean" interface to Hava
</ul>
<p><b>Known issues:</b>
<ul>
<li> Some channel change issues seen... (havas that aren't connected to component input maybe?
<li> Realizing that I need to create an out of order buffer for video packets and/or some way to deal with lost packets...  Probably a quality backoff mechanism
<li> MythTV module
<li> Autodetect a single hava on local network instead of using IP address
<li> Need to think about doing something if channel change acks are lost
</ul>
<p>
Tested on Windows XP, and Ubuntu 8.10 connecting to a Hava Wireless HD (hardware version 1003100, firmware version 270.322-32).   The Hava Wireless HD was connected to component (YPbPr) inputs and controls a Dish vip211 receiver.
<hr>
<h2>Release alpha1 -- 8/22/2009</h2>

Initial version of windows and linux binaries corresponds to SVN checkin number 4.  I tried to create an alpha1 tag for it but remain fairly inept with svn
<p>
Tested on Windows XP, and Ubuntu 8.10 connecting to a Hava Wireless HD (hardware version 1003100, firmware version 270.322-32).   The Hava Wireless HD was connected to component (YPbPr) inputs and controls a Dish vip211 receiver.
